    "# GitHub Workflow (Student-Friendly) — AQI Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows a **simple, easy-to-follow** way for our team to work with GitHub for the *AQI Monitoring* project. It focuses on practical steps for **Admin** and **Members**. No complex tools — just what we need to collaborate smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Goals\n",
    "- Everyone can **create issues**, **code on a branch**, **open a Pull Request (PR)**, get a **review**, and **merge** into `main` safely.\n",
    "- Keep `main` always runnable.\n",
    "- Use a small **Kanban board** to track tasks (Backlog → Doing → Review → Done).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Roles\n",
    "### Admin\n",
    "- Creates the repo and sets basic rules (branch protection).\n",
    "- Labels, Project board, and simple templates.\n",
    "- Reviews and merges PRs (or assigns reviewers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Member\n",
    "- Picks a task (issue), creates a **feature branch**, codes, pushes, opens a PR, asks for review, merges, and deletes the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) One-Page Flow (TL;DR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Member**\n",
    "1. Pick an issue from **Project Board** (move it to **Doing**).\n",
    "2. `git checkout -b feature/<issue-number>-<short-name>`\n",
    "3. Code → commit small steps → push.\n",
    "4. Open a **PR** to `main` → request review → fix comments (if any).\n",
    "5. **Squash & Merge** → delete branch → move card to **Done**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Admin (initial setup once)**\n",
    "1. Create repo on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Add `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docs/` (optional).\n",
    "3. Set **branch protection** on `main` (require PR + 1 approval).\n",
    "4. Create **Labels** and **Project (Kanban)**.\n",
    "5. Invite members.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Admin Setup (done once)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Create Repo\n",
    "- On GitHub: **New repository** → name `aqi-monitoring` → add README.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Branch Protection (Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`)\n",
    "- ✅ Require a pull request before merging\n",
    "- ✅ Require approvals: **1**\n",
    "- ✅ Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed\n",
    "- ✅ Require status checks to pass (optional if CI exists)\n",
    "- ✅ Restrict who can push (optional — only Admin/Maintainers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Project Board (GitHub Projects)\n",
    "- Create a **Board** named `Team Board` with columns: **Backlog**, **Ready**, **Doing**, **Review**, **Done**.\n",
    "- Automation (optional): new issues → Backlog; PR opened → Review; Closed → Done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Labels (examples)\n",
    "- `type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:docs`, `type:chore`\n",
    "- `P1` (urgent), `P2` (normal)\n",
    "- `area:api`, `area:ingest`, `area:dashboard`, `area:db`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Minimal Templates (optional)\n",
    "- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` → checklist (lint, tests, link issue).\n",
    "- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` and `bug_report.md` (short).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Issue Rules (Everyone)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Issue** with:\n",
    "- **Title**: short goal → “Daily AQI average by city”\n",
    "- **Description**: what to build & why (1–3 sentences)\n",
    "- **Acceptance Criteria**: bullet list of “done means…”\n",
    "- **Estimate**: S/M/L\n",
    "- **Labels**: type + area + priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**Move card** on the board:\n",
    "- Backlog → Ready (groomed) → Doing (assigned) → Review (PR opened) → Done (merged)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Commit message (Conventional Commits, short)**:\n",
    "- `feat(stations): add near search (#42)`\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# 1) Get latest main\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Create a task branch\n",

    "#    - Base: main, Compare: your feature branch\n",
    "#    - Add reviewers, labels, 'Closes #<issue-number>' in description\n",

    "git rebase origin/main\n",

    "## 8) Simple Conflict Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "When Git shows conflict markers `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` in files:\n",
    "1. Open the files, pick the correct lines, remove markers.\n",
    "2. `git add <fixed-file>`\n",
    "3. If you were rebasing: `git rebase --continue`\n",
    "4. If you were merging: `git merge --continue`\n",
    "5. If stuck: `git rebase --abort` or `git merge --abort` (then ask teammate).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you have a simple test (e.g., run `pytest`) or just want lint checks:\n",
    "- Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run on PR and push to `main`.\n",
    "- Keep it simple: install deps → `ruff/black/isort` → `pytest -q` (if tests exist).\n",
